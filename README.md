This is the repository that holds the billy robot's code. Billy is a robot that is running in a raspberry pi zero w board (for now).

## Billy's Main Goal
The first priority is to help humans by doing mainly physical work like opening windows, closing doors, switching the lights on/off or bringing objects to it's owner's hands. Here are some of the thoughts that motivates me building robots: 

* The lack of personal affordable human-sized useful robots in the actual society.
* My self-development as a computer scientist and human being.
* The lack of help that some people suffer for having physical disabilities.

I need to feed my cat when I'm traveling and I don't want to bother my neighbors.

## Rough Numbers
For adding arms, more sensors and a small power bank to Billy, I need to upgrade it's legs. To be sincere, I'm not quite sure about how much I need in total to make Billy a useful robot but I guess something around $900 would be enough:

* Roughly speaking I'll need $150 for the legs, 150 for a stronger "brain", 200 for a branch of new sensors and 400 to make it human sized (please see buy list at the end).
* I discovered a place where I can use some tools for building more parts, so I probably won't need to spend any more money buying tools.
* All money that I receive from this campaign will be spent on Billy.
* All money that trespass the goal will be spent on a brand new company that will build more Billy's.

## Future Ideas
Here are some other benefits that Billy could give us:

* Bring cans or snacks from the kitchen.
* Put your clothes in the washing machine.
* If you are a developer, you could control Billy remotely through internet (as I do right now) and this could be a game changing if you travel constantly.
* Write letters for you.
* Take pictures of you.

## Risks & Challenges
As the same as every single device connected to the internet, Billy could be a target for many different kinds of cyber attacks, but as long as the default operational system is Linux and the owner doesn't change the default configuration, security shouldn't be a problem. Today is possible to make machines recognize someone's voice and only obey that specific voice and register tasks that can be done for any voice.

One thing to be in mind though is that every tool can be used for bad things, and a robot would not be the exception for this rule. But I'll try to think more about this when I have a working robot, I promise.

Now here are some challenges that I'll be facing if this campaign grow successfully:

* Create and train a deep learning neural network to make Billy smarter.
* When I say smarter I mean: know how to avoid obstacles while walking, recognize objects, predict object's weight, know how to interact with different object shapes, balance the object's weight with itself weight while carrying it, recognizing animals, humans, memorizing their names and interacting with the environment (like doors or windows).
* Make sure the code is well organized and easy to implement if done by other person.

## Other Ways You Can Help

* If you are a developer and you know javascript, you can help me with the code! I'll be posting it on github shortly, so just stay tuned (https://github.com/tubaleviao).
* Also be free to provide any information or suggestion about different materials I can use to build the robot body (I'm using flatten wood sticks) or library, language, framework, new technology or even different robot designs. Any extra information may help.

## Buying List
* 10x Stall Torque (4.8v): 3.1kg/cm $11.95 servo link ($119.5)
* Portable small 10000ma power bank link ($27.99)
* 2x Ears (for guessing sound direction) link ($13.90)
* Accelerometer, passive buzzer, proximity sensor, pressure sensor (?)
* (update) Charger facilitator link ($14.95)
* Jetson nano link ($129)
* (big version) 10x more powerful servo link ($199.5)
* (big version) material for robot body (?)

Any help is appreciated :beer:
